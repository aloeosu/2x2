# Learning to solve a 2x2 cube
Today I memorized the last algorithm for solving the 2x2
1. **What did I learn about algorithms (today)?**
* I learned that algorithms are steps to solving something
2. **How do I know it was algorithmitic?**
* It was algorithmitic because you needed to follow steps to solve something
3. **What is an algorithm to you?**
* To me, an algorithm is a set of steps to solve something
